  Results of an inference on a file.

  The file contains two HDF5 datasets, preds and sample_names.

  The preds dataset first dimension represents the index of the sample.
  The next N dimensions depends the output of the CNN. If the CNN for
  instance generates a 1-dimensional output (vector) then N = 1 and the
  second dimension of the dataset corresponds to this array. If the output
  of the CNN is a grayscale bitmap then N = 2 and the two dimensions
  correspond to the bitmap dimensions.

  If no face is detected or if more than one face is detected, then
  data (vector, matrix, ...) is filled with zeros.

  Example:

    Assume a CNN that output a vector.

    preds[i][:] is the vector that is generated when the i-th input image
    is fed to the network.


  The sample_names dataset is a list of names of the sample encoded as
  UTF-8 strings.

  Example:

    sample_names[i] is the name of the sample i that was used to generate
    the prediction preds[i].

  The results also contain an optional HDF5 dataset called "class_names"
  that contains the mapping from the column index in the network output to
  the original class name in the dataset.
