title: Data tensors and annotations

description: |
  This format is used to store input and expected outputs of a neural network.

  The data is stored in HDF5. The input data for the network is stored in the dataset "input", the expected
  output data is stored in the "output" dataset. In both vectors the first dimension is the sample index.
  The other dimensions depend on the neural network. An additional dataset called "sample_names" stored in
  the file contains a list of UTF-8 strings, the string at position i is the name of the sample i in the input
  and output datasets. Moreover an additional dataset called "class_names" contains the names of each class
  corresponding to the index used in the output tensor.
