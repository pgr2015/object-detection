  This format shows layer by layer the results of the inference

  The file has the following format: HDF5

    GROUP "/" ATTRIBUTE "Name" : ASCII string with network name.

    GROUP "lyr" contains one group per layer. The name of the group
    is a string containing the index of the layer in an arbitrary order.

  Each group contains the following attributes:

    DataLayout:

      0 means that the data is the dump is organized as (sample id, channel
      id, height, width)

      1 means that the data is the dump is organized as (sample id, height,
      width, channel id)

    DataType:

      typedef enum { LPDNN_DT_U8 = 0,
                     LPDNN_DT_U16,
                     LPDNN_DT_U32,
                     LPDNN_DT_U64,
                     LPDNN_DT_S8,
                     LPDNN_DT_S16,
                     LPDNN_DT_S32,
                     LPDNN_DT_S64,
                     LPDNN_DT_F16,
                     LPDNN_DT_F32,
                     LPDNN_DT_F64};

    FracBits: the position of the decimal bit in fixed point

    Type: the type of layer

    Name: the name of the layer

  Each group also has a dataset name "output" containing the output.
