  name: com.bonseyes.examples.mnist
  description: |
    This task consists in recognizing handwritten digits. The input of the task is a gray scale image containing
    exactly one digit. The objective is to detect which digit is represented in the image.
  output: |
    The task output is the digit between 0 and 9 that has been recognized.
  constraints: |
    No constraints are defined.
  archives: |
    This task can be trained with the following archives:

      - http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz
      - http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz

    The archives format is specified at http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

  evaluation_criteria: |
    This task is evaluated using the accuracy metric. The accuracy is defined as the percentage of images for
    which the detected digit corresponds to the ground truth.

  cost_function: |
    The cost function that needs to be minimized is the categorical crossentropy.

  evaluation_dataset: |
    This task can be evaluated with the following archives:
      - http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz
